## Overview  

The challenge was to build out a news website homepage and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process  

I used flex box to solve the problem. First i divided the page into three sections:
- Header: contains the logo and the menu bar
- The main section: contains two sections:
  - The sidebar
  - The section with the image, big heading, text and button
- The section with cards  

all of this sections are flex boxes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

In future I would like to consider the CSS grid system and use it to sole the above challenge
